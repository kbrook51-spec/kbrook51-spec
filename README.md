# Hi! My name is Keiana 😁
## I am a graduate student at Arizona State in the GIT program.
## This semester I am learning more about coding and wireframes. I don't have a lot of experience with coding.
## I am currently a graphic designer at CBS Sports but my goal is to be a creative director one day.
