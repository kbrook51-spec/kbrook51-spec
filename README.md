# Hi! My name is Keiana 😁
======
## I am a graduate student at Arizona State studying Graphic Information Technology.

I am fairly new to coding and hope to improve my skills this semester.
I am currently a graphic designer at CBS Sports but my goal is to be a creative director one day.
Some of my hobbies include: watching horror movies, visiting amusement parks, and playing with my dog.
